# Simple Linear Regression on Weight-Height Dataset

This repository contains a simple linear regression implementation using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to predict height based on weight using the `weight_height.csv` dataset.

## 📁 Files

- `simple_lr.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook implementing linear regression using scikit-learn and matplotlib.
- `weight_height.csv`: CSV dataset containing weight and height data for individuals.

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset `weight_height.csv` includes the following columns:
- `Weight`: Weight of individuals (in pounds).
- `Height`: Height of individuals (in inches).

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Make sure you have Python installed with the following packages:
   - `numpy`
   - `pandas`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `scikit-learn`
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook simple_lr.ipynb
   ```
4. Run all cells to see the regression analysis and plot.

## 📈 Output

The notebook will:
- Load and visualize the data.
- Fit a linear regression model.
- Show the regression line on a scatter plot.
- Display evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.
