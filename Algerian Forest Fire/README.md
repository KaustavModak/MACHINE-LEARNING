# Algerian Forest Fires Prediction System

This repository contains both data analysis workflows and a web application for predicting Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) using meteorological and environmental data. The project focuses on forest fire incidents in Algeria, specifically in the **Bejaia** and **Sidi-Bel Abbes** regions during the summer season of 2012.

## üìä Dataset Description

The dataset includes 244 instances and 12 attributes (meteorological and FWI components), collected daily. It is segmented into two classes:
- **Fire**: days when a fire occurred
- **Not Fire**: days without fire

### Key Attributes:
- **Temperature (¬∞C)**, **Relative Humidity (%)**, **Wind Speed (km/h)**, **Rain (mm)**
- **FWI Components**: FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, BUI, FWI
- **Date**, **Region**, and **Target class** (Fire/Not Fire)

## üß™ Project Workflow

### 1. Data Exploration & Cleaning (`code1.ipynb`):
- Load and inspect the raw dataset.
- Handle missing or erroneous data entries.
- Convert data types, encode categorical features, and normalize numerical features.
- Visualize correlations between meteorological parameters and fire occurrences.

### 2. Machine Learning Model (`code2.ipynb`):
- Feature selection and engineering.
- Train/test split.
- Classification models applied: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM.
- Ridge Regression model trained for FWI prediction.
- Model performance evaluation using appropriate metrics.

### 3. Web Application (`application.py`):
- Flask-based web interface for prediction deployment.
- User input for meteorological parameters.
- Real-time FWI prediction using the trained Ridge Regression model.

## üöÄ Running the Web Application

1. Ensure all requirements are installed:
```bash
pip install flask pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

2. Run the Flask application:
```bash
python application.py
```

3. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/` in your web browser.
4. Use the welcome page or go to `/predictdata` to access the prediction form.
5. Enter the required parameters and submit to get FWI predictions.

### Input Parameters:
- Temperature (¬∞C)
- RH (Relative Humidity %)
- Ws (Wind Speed km/h)
- Rain (mm)
- FFMC (Fine Fuel Moisture Code)
- DMC (Duff Moisture Code)
- ISI (Initial Spread Index)
- Classes (Fire/Not Fire classification)
- Region (Bejaia/Sidi-Bel Abbes)
